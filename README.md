# gameboy_emulator
A WIP gameboy emulator written in Python 3 with a focus on OOP and simplicity. Not currently optimized for speed, but this is just for fun to see how far I can get.

Currently gets through the BIOS and displays the scrolling Nintendo logo. Crashes shortly after executing the game ROM.
